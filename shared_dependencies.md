The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. Next.js: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the pages files (`index.tsx`, `_app.tsx`, `_document.tsx`) and the `next.config.js` file.

2. React: This is the library used for building the user interface. It is used in all the pages files (`index.tsx`, `_app.tsx`, `_document.tsx`).

3. TypeScript: This is the programming language used for writing the application. It is used in all the `.tsx` files and the `tsconfig.json` file.

4. CSS: This is the language used for styling the application. It is used in the `globals.css` file and indirectly in the pages files through class names and id names.

5. Node.js: This is the runtime environment used for executing the application. It is used in the `package.json` file and the `next.config.js` file.

6. Browsers' API: This is used for interacting with the web browser. It is used in the `favicon.ico` file and indirectly in the pages files through DOM elements.

7. CommonJS: This is the module system used for importing and exporting modules. It is used in the `next.config.js` file and the `package.json` file.

8. ES Modules: This is the module system used for importing and exporting modules. It is used in all the `.tsx` files.

9. JSON: This is the data format used for storing configuration data. It is used in the `package.json` file and the `tsconfig.json` file.

10. HTML: This is the markup language used for creating the structure of web pages. It is used in all the pages files (`index.tsx`, `_app.tsx`, `_document.tsx`).

Please note that the actual names of exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, and function names would depend on the specific implementation of the application.
